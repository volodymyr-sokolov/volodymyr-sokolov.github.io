## Abstract

The paper presents the research of the stability of the system with a redundancy of communication channels. For this, two prototypes have been developed that are built (1) according to the classical circuit-switched scheme and (2) with an aggregation of several virtual channels. Prototyping, installation on various vehicles and measurements of the stability of the entire system as a whole were carried out. The paper also presents structural diagrams, hardware, and a list of problems and difficulties that the authors encountered during the practical implementation and implementation of these systems. In the future, it is planned to expand the study of these systems when working with high-level channel virtualization and the search for methods to accelerate its work.
