## Abstract

In modern conditions of abrupt changes in the military-political situation, the problem of ensuring the security and cyber protection of computer systems of situational centers of critical infrastructure facilities are acquired particular importance. Information systems of situational centers of critical infrastructure need meticulous attention to methods and tools. The paper presents an analysis of the components of cybersecurity and dependability. The research is based on the ontological approach to their mutual impact, determining the features of the complex influence of random errors and deliberate attacks. Based on the analysis of the attributes of dependability and cybersecurity, a game model is proposed. In addition to the cyber-attack entity, the approach considers another allied player entity, accidental factors of artificial and natural origin. However, implementing these factors can destroy the computer system's software and/or hardware platforms. However, it can also significantly affect the level of technical and cryptographic protection of the system. It is shown that it is necessary to ensure trust in the design procedures, configuration management, and safe installation, which are potential steps for implementing loopholes. Using the concept of a tuple of information elements in the framework of the proposed game model, a single criterion of dependability and cybersecurity of the computer (specifically, information) system of the situation center is formulated. A generalized model of dependability and cyber protection of the information system of the situation center of the critical infrastructure facility has been built. The given model allows a complex estimation of the dependability capacity of situational centers.
