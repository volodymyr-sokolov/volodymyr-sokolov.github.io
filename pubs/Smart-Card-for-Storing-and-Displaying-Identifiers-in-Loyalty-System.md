## Abstract
Smart card for storing and displaying identifiers in loyalty system, has protective primary layer, secondary layer with built-in display and applied pattern, tertiary layer and last layer that is formed above tertiary layer. The invention relates to smart cards with the additional functions of control and display on a built-in screen and can be used in providing the possibility of facilitating the identification of a client in discount systems with the aid of various output devices. The smart card for storing and displaying identifiers in loyalty systems comprises a central microcontroller, a read-only memory, a display and a power supply source, wherein said smart card consists of four layers, namely: a protective first layer; a second layer with a built-in display and an applied pattern; a third layer with a central microcontroller, control elements, wireless transmitters, a power supply source and a wireless transducer; and a fourth layer with a magnetic strip emulator and contacts. The smart card can exchange information with a mobile device comprising a wireless transducer, software and an additional read-only memory.
