## Abstract

This study focuses on the analysis of replay attacks, which pose a significant risk to remote control systems using the 433 MHz radio frequency band. A replay attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communications between two legitimate parties and resends the intercepted data to activate a remotely controlled system or commit identity theft. Special attention is paid to the study of the EV1527 protocol and its structure, as well as potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. The study includes a detailed analysis of the design documentation on modules using the EV1527 protocol, as well as an assessment of the characteristics of the corresponding antennas and the features of working with hardware and software. The work also includes a comparative analysis of the technical means that can be used to carry out the attack and a demonstration of a practical attack using the HackRF One software-controlled transceiver in a laboratory setting. The main goal of the work is to demonstrate the mechanisms for implementing a replay attack on remote control systems with static code and to develop recommendations for improving the security of these systems. The results of the study are aimed at increasing the understanding of potential risks and vulnerabilities, as well as at determining the feasibility of using such protocols in modern physical security and access control systems.
