## Abstract

The paper addresses new results of research on the use of an accelerating lens to increase throughput, range and noise immunity of exchange in a certain priority direction in the system of wireless access of IEEE 802.11 standard. Compared with previous works, efforts have been focused on solving these problems as applied to the MIMO systems, in which a problem emerges to choose an all-purpose lens profile to ensure the same conditions for increasing directional properties of the two (or more) antennas. This has required the development of a methodology for calculating the lens profile with allowance for two (or more) phase centers. The second factor that distinguishes the presented results is related to the analysis of the range properties of the lens and working out recommendations on the use of it in the frequency range used for servicing users in this standard. It seems rational to calculate lenses for a maximum wavelength that allows providing its relative transparency (and, consequently, certain efficiency) for shorter wavelengths range used, but with worse directional characteristics.
